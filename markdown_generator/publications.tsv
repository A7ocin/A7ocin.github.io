2016-07-24	Enhancing character posing by a sketch-based interaction	SIGGRAPH '16	Sketch as the most intuitive and powerful 2D design method has been used by artists for decades. However it is not fully integrated into current 3D animation pipeline as the difficulties of interpreting 2D line drawing into 3D. Several successful research for character posing from sketch has been presented in the past few years, such as the Line of Action [Guay et al. 2013] and Sketch Abstractions [Hahn et al. 2015]. However both of the methods require animators to manually give some initial setup to solve the corresponding problems. In this paper, we propose a new sketch based character posing system which is more flexible and efficient. It requires less input from the user than the system from [Hahn et al. 2015]. The character can be easily posed no matter the sketch represents a skeleton structure or shape contours.	Barbieri, Simone, et al.

This paper outlines the approach chosen by AUSILIA (Assisted Unit for Simulating Independent Living Activities), a living lab established in Provincia Autonoma di Trento in 2016 to develop an innovation model for taking care of the elderly or disabled patient by fusion of technology innovation and patient centered integrated care approach. AUSILIA goal is triple: i. to provide an innovative framework based on augmented virtual reality for occupational therapy in ageing and fragile individuals; ii. to help people who are losing autonomy and independence living at home reducing care burden; iii. warrant continuous innovation through the mixed contribution of the academy and private enterprise. The paper describes the specific solutions adopted for the three objectives, reporting an implementation example for each of them.	Grisenti, Andrea, et al.

Existing crowd models like the Social Force Model and the Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle, traditionally rely on empirically-defined functions to characterize the dynamics of a crowd. On the other hand, frameworks based on deep learning, like the Social LSTM and the Social GAN, have proven their ability to predict pedestrians trajectories without requiring a predefined mathematical model. In this paper we propose a new paradigm for crowd simulation based on a pool of LSTM networks. Each pedestrian is able to move independently and interact with the surrounding environment, given a starting point and a destination goal.	Bisagno, Niccol√≥, et al.
