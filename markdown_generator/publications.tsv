2016-07-24	Enhancing character posing by a sketch-based interaction	SIGGRAPH '16	Sketch as the most intuitive and powerful 2D design method has been used by artists for decades. However it is not fully integrated into current 3D animation pipeline as the difficulties of interpreting 2D line drawing into 3D. Several successful research for character posing from sketch has been presented in the past few years, such as the Line of Action [Guay et al. 2013] and Sketch Abstractions [Hahn et al. 2015]. However both of the methods require animators to manually give some initial setup to solve the corresponding problems. In this paper, we propose a new sketch based character posing system which is more flexible and efficient. It requires less input from the user than the system from [Hahn et al. 2015]. The character can be easily posed no matter the sketch represents a skeleton structure or shape contours.	Barbieri, Simone, et al.

This paper outlines the approach chosen by AUSILIA (Assisted Unit for Simulating Independent Living Activities), a living lab established in Provincia Autonoma di Trento in 2016 to develop an innovation model for taking care of the elderly or disabled patient by fusion of technology innovation and patient centered integrated care approach. AUSILIA goal is triple: i. to provide an innovative framework based on augmented virtual reality for occupational therapy in ageing and fragile individuals; ii. to help people who are losing autonomy and independence living at home reducing care burden; iii. warrant continuous innovation through the mixed contribution of the academy and private enterprise. The paper describes the specific solutions adopted for the three objectives, reporting an implementation example for each of them.	Grisenti, Andrea, et al.

2019-09-02	Virtual Crowds: An LSTM-Based Framework for Crowd Simulation.	ICIAP 2019	Social modeling of pedestrian dynamics is a key element to understand the behavior of crowded scenes. Existing crowd models like the Social Force Model and the Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle, traditionally rely on empirically-defined functions to characterize the dynamics of a crowd. On the other hand, frameworks based on deep learning, like the Social LSTM and the Social GAN, have proven their ability to predict pedestrians trajectories without requiring a predefined mathematical model. In this paper we propose a new paradigm for crowd simulation based on a pool of LSTM networks. Each pedestrian is able to move independently and interact with the surrounding environment, given a starting point and a destination goal.	Bisagno, Niccolo, et al.

2019-09-09	Unsupervised continuous camera network pose estimation through human mesh recovery	ICDSC 2019	Camera resectioning is essential in computer vision and 3D reconstruction to estimate the position of matching pinhole cameras in 3D worlds. While the internal camera parameters are usually known or can be easily computed offline, in camera networks extrinsic parameters need to be computed each time a camera changes position, thus not allowing for smooth and dynamic network reconfiguration. In this work we propose a fully markerless, unsupervised, and automatic tool for the estimation of the extrinsic parameters of a camera network, based on 3D human mesh recovery from RGB videos. We show how it is possible to retrieve, from monocular images and with just a weak prior knowledge of the intrinsic parameters, the real-world position of the cameras in the network, together with the floor plane. Our solution also works with a single RGB camera and allows the user to dynamically add, re-position, or remove cameras from the network.	Garau, Nicola, and Nicola Conci.

2019-10-28	Joint Trajectory and Fatigue Analysis in Wheelchair Users	ICCV 2019	A successful rehabilitation process always requires both medical and infrastructural support. In this paper we focus on paraplegic wheelchair users, aiming at understanding the correlation between accuracy in guidance and muscular fatigue, while moving on a known training path. In particular, we study the trajectories performed and the corresponding shoulder forces distribution, while changing the inclination of the seat. At the motor level, the point of interest is the shoulder, as, in the prolonged use of wheelchairs with manual self-propulsion, it is generally source of pain. The objective is to demonstrate that there is a potential relationship between trajectory discontinuities and shoulder pain, and foster the development of best practices aimed at preventing the raise of shoulder-related pathologies, by correcting the user's movements and the wheelchair setup. This project is meant to be a first study of the subject, so far little addressed, and is not meant to be a clinical study. The experiments have been conducted within the premises of the Living Lab AUSILIA and validated with the help of experienced medical personnel.	Sebastiani, Maddalena, et al.
