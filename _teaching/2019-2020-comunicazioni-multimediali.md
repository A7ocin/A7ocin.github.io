Teaching assistant for the course of Comunicazioni Multimediali (2019-2020).

Abstract
======

The course provides the basic notions as well as a set of application cases related to the technologies for the acquisition, processing, archiving and transmission of multimedia signals and their use in complex multimedia systems. Every topic is first introduced in the class from a theoretical viewpoint and then experienced in the lab by means of software simulation tools. The first part of the course introduces the basic concepts of digital signal processing (sampling, quantization, numerical transmission, frequency-domain representation, stochastic signals). The following part addresses the characterization of one- and multi-dimensional signals (sound, images, video), with particular reference to the problems related to the acquisition, AD conversion and representation of media objects. Then, the basic techniques of image and video processing are reviewed (filtering, description, analysis). Finally, the problem of multimedia signal representation and coding is presented making reference to the most common standard in the field (ISO and ITU coding families). The last part of the course proposes a set of application scenarios in specific areas of multimedia, also involving companies through dedicated seminars.
